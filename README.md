  ## Description
  
  - I created my portfolio page using my new React skills. It's a single-page application that contains information about me and most importantly it showcases some of my most recent web development applications. 
  - I used materialize css to style the final product
  
  The following screenshots demonstrate how the application appears in two different screen sizes.
