      <p>
      I'm a full stack web developer applying over ten years of experience as a mechanical engineer to build robust and efficient web applications. Recently completed a full stack web developer bootcamp through the University of Washington. In the course I learned and applied industry best practices in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to develop and support responsive web designs.</p>
      <p> My previous experience as a project engineer extended my technical and non-technical skills critical to leading teams through multi-year long mechanical design and qualification projects from inception to completion. In my current web application projects, I continue to leverage thorough planning by approaching big and small project milestones with equal importance in an agile software development environment. Passionate about learning and excited to join a team to provide technical and long lasting web application solutions.
